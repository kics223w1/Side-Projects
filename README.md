### Hi I'm Huy Cao, This is the summary of all my projects I have built. 
  - These are the projects which I have built when I started learning programming. At that time I haven't tried ReactJS yet, so they are all Android applications.

## Android Apps
 - [Password Generator](https://github.com/kics223w1/Password-Generator) is the app can generate password from the simple user input.
 - [Language Translator](https://github.com/kics223w1/Language-Translator) is the app can translate and storing language.
 - [Facebook Android](https://github.com/kics223w1/Rebuild-FaceBook-Android) is the social network app, the app is rebuild from Facebook Android App.
